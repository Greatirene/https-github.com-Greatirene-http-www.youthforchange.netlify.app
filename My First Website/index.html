                <p>Looking back at the History of women in tech, it highlights the women whose legacies continues to inspire the upcoming generation of female tech talent. The beginning of women in technology date back to the 1700s when Nicole-Reine Lepautre,
                    a French Mathematician and an astronomer predicted the return of Halley's Comet by calculating the timing of a solar eclipse. The team worked on the predictions for <i>six months</i> and results of her work called for an astronomical triumph! 
                Her results showed that the Comet would arrive on 13th April 1759, however as her results was almost precised, the Comet arrived on 13th March 1759.

                <br/> In the 1800s, there were obstacles for women in STEM. One of most shocking obstacles was the contradiction between the fact that colleges were opened for women and there were computer science courses for the women to take and teaching jobs for women, yet female faculty members in colleges 
                were forced to resign immediately they get married. Women have been placed in difficult and unfair situations throughout history and their male counterpatr haven't endure. This was an example of how conditional equality can be. Women had the opportunity pursue a career teaching in Computer science but having a career and marriage wasn't an option opened to them, 
                thus placing a huge barrier in the way of how many women were able to really work in the field of Mathematics and Science at that time.
                <p> We can't talk about women in tech without talking about the monumental achievements of some women whose work changed the future of technology for the better. Among these great women was <b>Ada Lovelace</b>, who is widely recognised as the first <i>computer programmer.</i> The contributions of Ada Lovelace to technology were recognised recently by B.V Bowden in 1950s 
                as she republished her notes in <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/10719/Faster-Than-Thought-A-Symposium-on-Digital-Computing-Machines-1953/" target="_blank" style="color: black;" > <i>Faster than Thought:A symposium on Digital Computing Machines.</i> </a> Ada Lovelace has become a role model to many young women, inspiring them to choose a career in Tech.
                There were other 20th- century women has also contributed and played important role in the technology field. Some of these great include <a href="https://www.womenintech.co.uk/10-famous-women-technology-changed-world/" target="_blank" style="color: black;"> <i> Hedy Lamarr, Annie Easley, Mary Wilkes, Katherine Johnson and Adele Goldberg.</i> </a>  </p>
                <h2> The Story of Technology Now </h2>

                <p> <img src="img/tech1.jpg" height="100%" width="100%"> <br/> The 21st century has largely been characterised by consistent attempts to bridge the gender gap in tech,
                    thus attracting more women into working in various sectors in the tech industry. This comes with the 
                    demands for equal salary and access to leadership positions despite the uphill battle for women in tech.
                    In a survey coducted in 2019, <a href="https://www.womenintech.co.uk/women-technology-survey-2019" target="_blank" style="color: black;"> <i>statistics of Women in Tech </i></a>still shows that women make up only about a quarter of the industry. There is clearly still a long way to reach gender equality in the tech industry.
                    However, the 21st century has the potential to change the untold history of women in tech!
